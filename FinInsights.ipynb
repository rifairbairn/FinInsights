    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explored using OpenAI's API to generate natural language insights from portfolio data. I tested the approach on a range of questions - including sector allocations, top performers, and company similarity based on business descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was generally able to extract and summarise useful information, particularly for questions involving rankings or comparisons (e.g. top performers). It handled business descriptions quite well when asked about company similarities. However, the accuracy of numerical breakdowns (like allocation totals) was mixed, and explanations were often generic or shallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key limitation is that the model only sees a subset of the data due to token limits. This means answers may miss context or appear biased towards the first few rows. It's also worth noting that the model isnâ€™t accessing real-time news or external information - it's only working off the data I provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it shows promise as a lightweight assistant for interpreting structured data. Future iterations could include pre-processed summaries (e.g. sector totals), embedding-based similarity rather than text matching, and integration with a wider data pipeline (e.g. newsflow, fundamentals, macro data)."
